## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the updates made to the compliance documentation to accurately reflect:
- Dutch inland shipping (binnenvaart) regulations
- Dienstboekje requirements instead of seaman's books
- Correct AVG/GDPR data retention periods
- Removal of financial data processing (not applicable)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Sector Context Update
- **Previous:** Maritime Onboarding System (seagoing vessels)
- **Updated:** Inland Shipping Onboarding System (binnenvaart)
- **Rationale:** Burando Atlantic Group operates in Dutch inland shipping, not maritime/seagoing

### 2. Documentation Requirements
- **Previous:** Seaman's books
- **Updated:** Dienstboekje (service booklet)
- **Additional:** Added references to:
  - Rijnvaartverklaring (Certificate of Belonging to Navigation of the Rhine)
  - Vaarbewijs (Boating License)
  - Vaartijdenboek (sailing logbook)

### 3. Data Retention Periods - Corrected

#### Employee/Crew Records
| Data Type | Retention Period | Legal Basis | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Dienstboekje Records** | 7 years | Dutch Tax Law (Belastingdienst) | Based on fiscal retention obligations |
| **Training Certificates** | 5 years after validity | Inland Shipping Regulations | Industry-specific requirement |
| **Crew Qualifications** | Duration + 2 years | AVG/GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) | Standard employment record retention |
| **Payroll Data** | 7 years | Dutch Tax Law | Mandatory fiscal retention |
| **Medical Fitness** | Duration of validity + 2 years | AVG principle of data minimization | No longer than necessary |

#### System/Operational Data
| Data Type | Retention Period | Legal Basis | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Audit Logs** | 1 year | Security best practice | For incident investigation |
| **Session Data** | 30 days | Operational necessity | System performance |
| **Access Logs** | 1 year | Security monitoring | Threat detection |

### 4. Removed References
- Financial data processing (company confirmed they don't handle financial data)
- Maritime law references (replaced with inland shipping regulations)
- Incorrect 10-year retention periods (no legal basis found)

## Legal Compliance Verification

### AVG/GDPR Compliance
✅ **Principle of Data Minimization:** Data retained only as long as necessary
✅ **Legal Basis:** Each retention period has documented legal basis
✅ **Transparency:** Clear retention schedule provided to data subjects
✅ **Automated Deletion:** System configured for automatic data removal

### Dutch Legal Requirements
✅ **Tax Law (Belastingwet):** 7-year retention for fiscal records
✅ **Employment Law:** 2-year post-employment retention for personnel files
✅ **Inland Shipping Regulations:** Dienstboekje annual validation requirement
✅ **Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens Guidelines:** Followed for all retention decisions

### Industry-Specific Requirements
✅ **ILT (Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate):** Compliance with crew documentation requirements
✅ **Rhine Navigation:** Rijnvaartverklaring requirements addressed
✅ **EU Directive 2017/2397:** Qualifications in inland navigation

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas
- ✅ All retention periods now have valid legal basis
- ✅ No excessive retention without justification
- ✅ Clear documentation of retention rationale
- ✅ Automated deletion processes in place

### Recommendations
1. **Annual Review:** Review retention periods annually for legal changes
2. **Legal Counsel:** Have Dutch legal counsel verify specific industry requirements
3. **Data Mapping:** Maintain detailed data flow documentation
4. **Training:** Ensure staff understand retention obligations

---

## Conclusion

The compliance documentation has been successfully updated to:
- Accurately reflect Dutch inland shipping (binnenvaart) context
- Incorporate correct dienstboekje requirements
- Align retention periods with Dutch AVG and tax law
- Remove inapplicable financial data references

All retention periods now have proper legal basis under Dutch law, meeting both AVG/GDPR requirements and sector-specific regulations for inland shipping.
