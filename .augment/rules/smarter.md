CRITICAL: The correct Supabase project ID is ocqnnyxnqaedarcohywe (maritime-onboarding-fresh). NEVER use vaajzxvtgiwwcjuiqtnr - this is the wrong database that has caused repeated issues.

I understand u want to create a solution, but dont skip steps or find easy work arounds, if u know smth is the best solution and it doesnt work from the first try, inform the user and ask what to do. Do not user positivity bias, but create real working and testted code.

Always use:
- serena for semantic code retrieval and editing tools
- context7 for up to date documentation on third party code
- sequential thinking for any decision making

1. Don't fix what isn't broken
2. Test before committing 
3. Run type error and linting checks
4. use native tools such as the supabase integration.

claude: when using claude code in the terminal the command to start it is: claude, how to use claude effectovly is found at https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices and https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/contextual-retrieval

 never use pkill -f node as it kills VSCode too
