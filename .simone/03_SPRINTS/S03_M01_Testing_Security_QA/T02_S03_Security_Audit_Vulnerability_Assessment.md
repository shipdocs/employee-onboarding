# Task T02_S03: Security Audit & Vulnerability Assessment

## 🎯 Task Overzicht

Voer een uitgebreide security audit uit om alle potentiële beveiligingslekken te identificeren en op te lossen, met als doel zero high/critical security vulnerabilities te bereiken.

## 📋 Detailed Requirements

### **Primary Objectives**
1. **Comprehensive Security Audit**: Volledige security assessment van het systeem
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identificatie en classificatie van security issues
3. **Security Fixes**: Implementatie van fixes voor gevonden vulnerabilities
4. **Security Monitoring**: Setup van security monitoring en alerting

### **Scope Definition**

#### **Security Audit Areas**
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Login security, session management, permissions
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF protection
- **API Security**: Endpoint security, rate limiting, data exposure
- **Database Security**: Access controls, data encryption, backup security
- **Infrastructure Security**: Server configuration, network security, deployment security

#### **Vulnerability Assessment Categories**
- **Critical**: Immediate security threats requiring urgent fixes
- **High**: Significant security risks requiring prompt attention
- **Medium**: Moderate security concerns requiring planned fixes
- **Low**: Minor security improvements for enhanced security posture

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **1. Authentication & Authorization Security**

#### **Authentication Security Review**
```javascript
// Security checklist for authentication
const authSecurityChecks = {
  passwordSecurity: [
    'Password complexity requirements',
    'Password hashing (bcrypt/scrypt)',
    'Account lockout mechanisms',
    'Session timeout configuration'
  ],
  sessionManagement: [
    'Secure session tokens',
    'Session invalidation on logout',
    'Session hijacking protection',
    'Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection'
  ]
};
```

**Security Areas to Review:**
- [ ] Password policies and hashing mechanisms
- [ ] Session management and token security
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication implementation
- [ ] Account lockout and brute force protection
- [ ] Permission and role-based access controls

#### **Authorization Security Review**
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- [ ] API endpoint permission validation
- [ ] Database row-level security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Frontend route protection and access controls

### **2. Input Validation & Data Security**

#### **Input Validation Security**
```javascript
// Example security validation
const securityValidation = {
  sqlInjection: 'Parameterized queries and ORM usage',
  xssProtection: 'Input sanitization and output encoding',
  csrfProtection: 'CSRF tokens and SameSite cookies',
  fileUpload: 'File type validation and size limits'
};
```

**Validation Areas:**
- [ ] SQL injection prevention in all database queries
- [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- [ ] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- [ ] File upload security and validation
- [ ] API input validation and sanitization

#### **Data Protection Security**
- [ ] Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Personal data handling and GDPR compliance
- [ ] Database backup security and encryption
- [ ] Logging security and sensitive data exclusion

### **3. API & Infrastructure Security**

#### **API Security Assessment**
```javascript
// API security checklist
const apiSecurityChecks = {
  authentication: 'JWT token validation and expiration',
  authorization: 'Endpoint-level permission checks',
  rateLimiting: 'Request rate limiting and throttling',
  dataExposure: 'Sensitive data exposure prevention'
};
```

**API Security Areas:**
- [ ] API authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] API versioning and deprecation security
- [ ] Error handling and information disclosure prevention
- [ ] API documentation security review

#### **Infrastructure Security Review**
- [ ] Server configuration and hardening
- [ ] Network security and firewall configuration
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate management
- [ ] Environment variable and secrets management
- [ ] Deployment pipeline security

## 📊 Security Assessment Tools

### **Automated Security Scanning**
- [ ] **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Code vulnerability scanning
- [ ] **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: Runtime vulnerability testing
- [ ] **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party library vulnerability assessment
- [ ] **Container Security**: Docker image and container security scanning

### **Manual Security Testing**
- [ ] **Penetration Testing**: Manual security testing of critical flows
- [ ] **Code Review**: Manual review of security-critical code sections
- [ ] **Configuration Review**: Security configuration assessment
- [ ] **Social Engineering Assessment**: User awareness and training evaluation

## 🔍 Implementation Steps

### **Phase 1: Automated Security Assessment (Days 1-3)**
1. **Setup Security Scanning Tools**: Configure SAST/DAST tools
2. **Dependency Vulnerability Scan**: Assess third-party library risks
3. **Code Security Analysis**: Automated code vulnerability detection
4. **Infrastructure Security Scan**: Server and network security assessment

### **Phase 2: Manual Security Review (Days 4-6)**
1. **Authentication Flow Review**: Manual testing of login and session management
2. **Authorization Testing**: Permission and access control validation
3. **Input Validation Testing**: Manual testing for injection vulnerabilities
4. **API Security Testing**: Endpoint security and data exposure testing

### **Phase 3: Vulnerability Remediation (Days 7-8)**
1. **Critical Vulnerability Fixes**: Immediate fixes for critical issues
2. **High Priority Fixes**: Prompt fixes for high-risk vulnerabilities
3. **Security Monitoring Setup**: Implement security alerting and monitoring
4. **Security Documentation**: Document security procedures and findings

## 📊 Success Criteria

### **Vulnerability Targets**
- [ ] **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0 (zero tolerance)
- [ ] **High Vulnerabilities**: 0 (zero tolerance)
- [ ] **Medium Vulnerabilities**: < 5 (with mitigation plans)
- [ ] **Low Vulnerabilities**: < 10 (with improvement roadmap)

### **Security Compliance**
- [ ] **OWASP Top 10**: Full compliance with OWASP security guidelines
- [ ] **Data Protection**: GDPR compliance for personal data handling
- [ ] **Industry Standards**: Adherence to maritime industry security standards
- [ ] **Best Practices**: Implementation of security best practices

### **Security Monitoring**
- [ ] **Real-time Monitoring**: Security event detection and alerting
- [ ] **Incident Response**: Documented security incident procedures
- [ ] **Regular Audits**: Scheduled security review processes
- [ ] **Security Training**: Team security awareness and training

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **Security Risks**
- **Critical Vulnerability Discovery**: Immediate response and fix procedures
- **False Positives**: Manual validation of automated scan results
- **Performance Impact**: Security measures balanced with system performance

### **Implementation Risks**
- **Fix Complexity**: Prioritize fixes based on risk and complexity
- **System Disruption**: Careful testing of security fixes in staging environment
